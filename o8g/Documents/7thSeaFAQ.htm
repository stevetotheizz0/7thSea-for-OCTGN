<P class="p248 ft0">To paraphrase, the rulebook says that the Crew pushed forward must tack and sink to absorb Hits until they are sunk, then any remaining hits spill over to the remainder of the crew.</P>
<P class="p10 ft0">This basically means that other crew may not tack or sink to absorb the hits until the spill over occurs.</P>
<P class="p249 ft0">However, action cards, and crew cards for that matter, which have an ability along the lines of "React: Play when you are suffering Hits. You suffer 2 fewer Hits." do get to help absorb Hits.</P>
<P class="p250 ft7">Here's why. Cards always overrule the rulebook. The rules say that only the pushed forward Crew may absorb the Hits. But, let's say you have a Brutes which was not pushed forward. The Brutes say they absorb extra Hits when they tack to absorb Hits. But the card says nothing about being able to absorb Hits for another card, or about absorbing Hits at a time they are not suffering Hits (which in this case the Brutes are not suffering Hits, the pushed forward crew is). Near Miss, on the other hand, says "React: Play when you suffer Hits during Boarding. You suffer 2 fewer Hits." So, the other guys hits you.

<P class="p12 ft0"><SPAN class="ft1">-</SPAN><SPAN class="ft13">Erik Yaple, 7th Sea CCG Lead Developer</SPAN></P>
<P class="p12 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">I.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft14">Tournament </SPAN><NOBR>Rules-----</NOBR></P>
<P class="p313 ft0"><SPAN class="ft1">A.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft15">60 cards minimum per deck, including one Captain and one Ship cards. This does not include the 5 Seas. No more than 3 copies of a card in a deck.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p134 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">B.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft15">Acceptable Tournament Formats: Single Elimination, Double Elimination and Swiss. It is recommended that each tournament round should last no longer than 45 minutes.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p314 ft7"><SPAN class="ft7">C.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">If a Swiss format is utilized, players winning a round using the </SPAN><NOBR>over-time</NOBR> rules should be awarded 2 points towards moving to the finals. One point is awarded for either a Control win in <NOBR>over-time</NOBR> or going to the 7th Sea. After the predetermined number of Swiss rounds have been completed, the top players (number to be predetermined before the tournament begins, depending on size of tournament) with the highest point total shall advance to the finals. If players are tied for point totals, then the player with the most wins should advance to the finals; if still tied then the "difficulty of schedule" should be calculated by the Tournament Organizer to break the tie. A player's "difficulty of schedule" is the sum of the point totals of that player's opponents. If this results in another tie, decide randomly which player will advance.</P>
<P class="p315 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">D.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft17">Players are forbidden from altering their deck composition once the tournament has begun. Illegal deck composition will result in disqualification.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p316 ft7"><SPAN class="ft7">E.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">When playing in a Sealed deck game players may ignore any factional restrictions for bringing a card into play. This includes, but is not limited to, the Loyal trait, Factional Based Attachments (i.e. Montaigne Captain Attachment or Sea Dogs Ship Attachment), and any card that says that you must be from X faction to play (i.e. Wild Party, Galley Captives), etc. Restrictions regarding Villainous / Heroic and any other trait still apply. Reduced costs based on factional alignment still apply as normal. Bonuses based on faction (i.e. Captains) apply normally.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p283 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">F.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">New cards from expansions are forbidden from use in tournament play until 30 days after the general release to the public (with the exception of sealed deck play). However, rules clarifications and errata from expansions are considered to always be in effect; this includes newly updated printed versions of cards (MRP).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p317 ft1"><SPAN class="ft1">G.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft20">Employees of Alderac Entertainment Group are not allowed to play in any sanctioned event. AEG </SPAN><NOBR>Play-Testers</NOBR> and AEG Bounty Hunter Demonstration Team representatives are only allowed to play in sanctioned events when they are not Judging the tournament by themselves. Judges are not allowed to play in the same event that they are judging, unless using a "three judge system."</P>
<P class="p318 ft7"><SPAN class="ft7">H.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft16">A three judge system may be utilized in order to allow the judges to play in the tournament. Three judges are needed to use this system: a primary judge, secondary judge, and a tertiary judge. The primary organizes the event as a normal judge would with the help of the secondary and tertiary judges. The primary judge makes the rulings for the tournament except for matches he is involved in. When the primary judge is involved in a match and requires a ruling, the secondary judge makes this ruling. When the primary and secondary judges are involved in the same match, the tertiary judge makes the rulings for that match. This way a judge never makes a ruling on his own behalf. If three judges are not available, this system may not be used; one judge must judge the tournament without playing. This may not be used in </SPAN><NOBR>multi-player</NOBR> tournaments.</P>
<P class="p319 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">I.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft14">A Judges' decision is final. Further protest after the Judge has made a decision as to rule interpretation may result in disqualification.</SPAN></P>

<P class="p320 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">J.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft21">Players will conduct themselves in a </SPAN><NOBR>sportsman-like</NOBR> manner: respecting judges and other players alike. Players behaving in an unsportsmanlike manner may be disqualified from the tournament by the judge. This includes but is not limited to: harassment of participants, "stalling" during game play in order to take advantage of the overtime rules, cheating, etc.</P>
<P class="p321 ft7"><SPAN class="ft7">K.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft18">If Time for a tournament round has expired without a winner, the current Action phase is considered concluded immediately as time is called (the acting player may finish his current "action" and any Boarding currently in progress is considered ended at the conclusion of the current round of the Boarding). The surviving players resolve the end of the turn (Draw Cards, then Untack) and then continue the game under the overtime rules (the 7th Sea). Note: If any player is the only player that controls all five Seas at this point, that player wins the game (and is awarded the full 2 points if the Tournament Organizer is using a Swiss style tournament system). If two or more players control all five Seas, play continues to the 7th Sea as normal.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p322 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">L.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">If a Tournament Organizer wishes to use one of the Alternative </SPAN><NOBR>0ver-time</NOBR> Systems provided, he must announce which system he will be using for the tournament 15 minutes before the first round of the tournament.</P>

<P class="p12 ft0"><SPAN class="ft1">A.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft15">The 7th Sea</SPAN></P>
<P class="p4 ft0">This is the standard overtime resolution system used for 7th Sea.</P>
<P class="p108 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">1.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">If one (and only one) player controls 3 or more Seas, that player immediately wins the game. If two or more players control 3 or more Seas, the player that controls the most Seas wins the game. Any player winning the game at this point is awarded 1 point in a Swiss style tournament. If there continues to be a tie for the most number of Seas controlled, play continues to the next step.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p55 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">2.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">All Seas, Sea Attachments, uncompleted Adventures, and Chanteys are removed from play - the players "move to the 7th</SPAN></P>
<P class="p15 ft0">Sea".</P>
<P class="p323 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">3.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">New Crew, Attachments, Adventures and Chanteys may not be put into play. Although you may not play any new Attachments, you may play Action cards that become Attachments (i.e. Major Hull Damage, Artifact Leg, etc.).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p324 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">Cancel costs (involving skill point costs) are doubled while in the 7th Sea. This includes, but is not limited to, canceling Boarding Attempts, cancel costs in red flags and cancel costs listed in card text. This does not include the costs of cards that cancel (i.e. Hiding in the Reefs, Will Do You No Good, etc.) or card effects that cancel (i.e. The Scarlet Roger).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p325 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">Any action which causes a Ship to move to another Sea is resolved normally, but the movement portion of the action is ignored. There are no Seas adjacent to the 7th Sea.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p58 ft1"><SPAN class="ft1">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft22">The inherent ability of Crew to tack to absorb hits can not be used in the 7th Sea (although they may still sink to absorb hits normally). Card effects which require you to tack your Crew and then absorb hits as part of their effect apply as normal. (i.e. Nice Try)</SPAN></P>

<P class="p109 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">4.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">A Duel begins between the Captains. The player with initiative chooses to either play a Boarding Attack or pass. The other player must then either start the Duel (if not already begun) or respond normally.</SPAN></P>
<P class="p58 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">5.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">During this Boarding Attack all cards in the players' decks are considered blank and only the Boarding Boxes are referenced (thus a "Riposte" would only reverse a Boarding Attack printed in its Boarding Boxes).</SPAN></P>
<P class="p266 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">6.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">If a player exhausts his play hand (having no cards in his hand) and thus unable to reverse the opponent's Boarding Attack, that player may draw 3 cards from their deck into their hand.

<P class="p328 ft0"><SPAN class="ft0">7.</SPAN><SPAN class="ft19">When a player can no longer reverse his opponent's Boarding Attack, he loses and the other player wins the game. (if using a Swiss style tournament format the player is awarded 1 point).</SPAN></P>
